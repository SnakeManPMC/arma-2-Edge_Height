# arma-2-Edge_Height

ArmA 2 tool to set 4WVR terrain edges to specific height (usually the ocean bottom to deeper level)

In ArmA 2 we have beautiful ocean water colors, these color changes appear in specific depths. With this tool you can set your ocean depts to any number.

Remember that in WrpTool and OFP the value gets cut off deeper than -50m, however you can still use very deep values for ArmA 2 like -300m when you export the terrain with WrpRipper for example.
